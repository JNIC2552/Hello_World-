Hello-World!

The 31st was wacky as we lost a well known James Bond actor but at the same time we got to see a very radiant blue full moon.
November will fly by fast and next thing we know its already 2021. 
There was already chirstmas decorations when october began
Traveled around the world due to being a military brat, places being Florida, California, Alaska, Guam, Japan and recently South Korea. Feels good to finally be in my homestate after all these years of traveling.
